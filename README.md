[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Angie55/milestoneFour-chocify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Angie55/milestoneFour-chocify)

Chocify is an ecommerce store selling novelty chocolate gifts. It was created as a final project of a Code Institute web development diploma
to display skills learnt over the course. The overall aim is to build a custom built Django project composed of multiple apps. Chocify is a 
fictional brand using images and content from 2 real brands. This project was designed to show case the products in an appealing way that 
encourages the customer to browse and make a purchase. The focus is on the user having an effortless experience with a design that feels intuitive.

## Developer goals

- To create a Django full stack project, composed of multiple apps to build a functioning ecommerce store. Considering all the necessary steps 
required in browsing and purchasing products with each app.

- To design an attractive website that looks visually appealing but puts the focus on the products.  

- To make navigation easy and give clear feedback and instructions to the user.

- To create a user authentication mechanism so the user can register and login to make purchases. 

- Designs a relational database schema that is well suited to the online store and products.

- To ensure the user can safely and securely make payments for products on the site.

- To expand on what I have learnt about Django project back ends during the final part of the course and improving skills from previous modules.

### Design Choices

The overall design is clean and boutique like with a few subtle colours. The products have intricate details that can be shown 
of better with clean simple surroundings. The designs are quirky and fun so the design lets them stand out and be the focus 
with subtle, cute colours.

#### Font
After exploring several fonts and looking across several sites that specialise in chocolate I found Poppins looked best on the site. 
I tried some combinations but found Poppins fitted well, slightly heaver as headers and lighter for the main text. It is very easy to 
read but has a friendly and very slight playful feel to the shape of the letter. I feel this complimented the quirky theme without being 
too overly styled. 

#### Icons
All the icons used are from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/), they are simple and clearly represent what they are used for or help 
add emphasis in some areas. 

#### Styling
- Rounded edges and thin borders are used for a soft, friendly feel. The subtle box shadows bring the images up and way from the background 
so they stand out more.
- A simple colour transition is used when hovering over buttons and links and the feedback is keep the same across the site.
- Horizontal rules are used to separate content or at the end so the eye can easily navigate the content.
- Images are kept large where possible to show the details in the products.
- Pages such a registration, login, profile, resetting password etc.,are all kept very simple so the focus is on what the user is on that page for.

#### Colours

The colour pink appeared on a few of the chocolate sites I browsed along with a deep brown. I think that many shades of pink compliment the browns 
used in designs as well as the shades of real chocolates itself. I sampled a few pinks and chose one that worked really well with dark, milk and 
white chocolate as well as the deep brown. 

Pink can be seen as a fun, compassionate colour with gives a friendly feels on the site.

The brown is obvious colour connected to chocolate but also used sparingly to compliment the contents.

- ![#43281e](https://placehold.it/15/43281e/43281e) `#43281e` (**Dark Chesnut**)

The greys work well with the pink and give a gentle, soft touch around the bright, punchy product images.

- ![#baa999](https://placehold.it/15/baa999/baa999) `#baa999` (**Warm Smokey Grey**)
- ![#ddd](https://placehold.it/15/ddd/ddd) `#ddd` (**Light Grey**)

The blue and greens used for buttons are fairly standard to action buttons and the blue was also a good contrast to show the cart count.
